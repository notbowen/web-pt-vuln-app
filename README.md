# Web Pentesting Vulnerable Application

This is a web application that is vulnerable to path traversal and SQL injection.
It is meant to be used as a hands-on lab during Nullsec's Web Pentesting workshop.

Pardon me for the complete dumpster fire, I ChatGPT-ed half the code and hacked together
the other half. Was a great learning opportunity tho.
